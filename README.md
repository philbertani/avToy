avToy => Audio Visual Toy => Music Visualizer in other words

This was refactored/branched from audioAnimated (which can do a lot more interesting things with audio), but I wanted a version that could be free from the backend database and file transfers, in order to just let users get a local audio file playing and connected to Visualizers.

philbertani.github.io/avToy  is the working web page
